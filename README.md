# Impossible Powder

## TL;DR

**An electrolyte powder built to lift, not to run a marathon.**

Most electrolyte products feature high sodium and sugar content because they're designed for cardio and atlethes who sweat for hours. Power lifters don't need that!
What we actually lose during strength training and what the research says matters for power output and recovery,is magnesium and zinc. 

> Impossible Powder flips the script: low sodium, high magnesium, added zinc and a dose of taurine for recovery. No sugar, no vitamin C megadoses that blunt your gains.

## Formula

### Ingredient Breakdown

| Ingredient | Amount | Evidence-based Benefit |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
| Tripotassium Citrate | 690 mg | Citrate form alkalizes blood pH, enhances mineral absorption, supports neuromuscular function |
| Potassium Chloride | 420 mg | Completes chloride for fluid balance, additional potassium supports muscle contraction and nerve transmission |
| Trisodium Citrate | 745 mg | Citrate improves bioavailability of other minerals, supports fluid balance without GI issues |
| Magnesium Malate | 1,000 mg | Malic acid directly feeds Krebs cycle → ATP production. Studies show improved quadriceps torque (+29%) with adequate Mg. Clears lactate from muscles. |
| Calcium Citrate | 285 mg | Absorbed without stomach acid (can take any time), supports muscle contraction and nerve signaling |
| Zinc Picolinate | 58 mg | 40%+ absorption rate. Supports testosterone synthesis, protein synthesis, immune function. 22% of athletes are deficient. |
| L-Taurine | 1,500 mg | 68% of studies show benefits. Reduces muscle damage markers (CK, LDH), increases training volume, reduces lactate, cell volumizing effect. |
| Citric Acid | 400 mg | Provides tart flavor, improves solubility, creates optimal pH for mineral absorption |
| Ascorbic Acid | 25 mg | Low-dose preservative/antioxidant. Does NOT impair training adaptations at this dose (unlike high-dose 500mg+). |
| Stevia Reb-A 97% | 40 mg | Zero glycemic impact, no effect on insulin, cleanest aftertaste at high purity |
| Erythritol | 1,500 mg | Zero calories, zero glycemic impact, no GI distress, provides body and mouthfeel |
| **TOTAL** | **6,663 mg** | |

**Serving size:** ~6.6g powder mixed into 500ml or 1l of water

### Taste & Sweeteners

The formula uses stevia (Reb A) + erythritol — same approach as Ultima, Key Nutrients and most credible zero-sugar competitors.

- **Stevia (30-50mg):** Provides sweetness without calories or blood sugar impact. Reb A is the cleanest-tasting steviol glycoside.
- **Erythritol (1-1.5g):** Adds body and mouthfeel that stevia alone can't deliver. Zero glycemic index, no GI distress (unlike maltitol or sorbitol) and about 70% as sweet as sugar.

Citrus flavor profiles (lemon-lime, orange) tend to mask mineral taste better than berry. The citric acid already in the formula helps here.

| Sodium | 175 mg | 55 mg | 1,000 mg | 330 mg | 160 mg |
| **Potassium** | **470 mg** | 250 mg | 200 mg | 185 mg | 50 mg |
| **Magnesium** | **150 mg** | 100 mg | 60 mg | 39 mg | 0 mg |

| Target Use | **Strength** | General | Keto/Fasting | Rehydration | Endurance |

**Where impossible is possible:**
- Highest potassium on market (470mg)
- Highest magnesium in the category (150mg vs. typical 20-100mg)
- Only formula with meaningful zinc dosing (12mg vs. "trace" or nothing)
- Only formula with taurine for recovery
- Balanced chloride supply
- Low sodium by design, not by accident

> Electrolytes finally made for people who lift. Not runners, not cyclists, not people doing zumba.

## To Do

### Taste Testing
- Need to prototype 2-3 flavor profiles (lemon-lime, citrus punch, unflavored) and get feedback on mineral aftertaste
- Test stevia/erythritol ratios — some people are sensitive to stevia's bitter notes at higher concentrations
- Evaluate monk fruit as a stevia alternative or blend component

### Solubility & Mixability
- Magnesium malate and taurine are both water-soluble, but need to verify the full formula dissolves cleanly in cold water without clumping
- Test dissolution time — target under 30 seconds with light stirring
- Check if citric acid level is sufficient to keep everything in solution or if we need to adjust

### Regulatory
* [] Confirm label claims for "supports muscle recovery" / "strength training" don't cross into drug claim territory
* [] Verify all ingredients and doses are GRAS at specified levels
