# Impossible Powder

## TL;DR

**An electrolyte powder specifically made for strength training**

Most electrolyte mixes are built for long cardio sessions. That's why they're heavy on sodium and sugar. If you hit the gym and lift weights, that approach doesn't really match what you're doing.
During resistance training, sweat loss is lower, but mineral turnover (especially magnesium and zinc) still matters for performance and recovery.

> Impossible Powder keeps sodium and sugars modest while providing what you most need for strength training: meaningful doses of magnesium, zinc and potassium — all in EU-authorised forms with full regulatory compliance. No empty sugar, no filler vitamins and no vitamin C mega-doses that interfere with strength adaptations.

**Serving size:** ~7.5 g mixed into 500 ml water
**Recommended intake:** 1–2 servings per day

> Note: The formula's citrate load (~1.5 g total citrate) produces a modest alkalinizing effect that is protective against kidney stones and mildly supportive of exercise buffering. The solution is hypotonic (~135 mOsm/kg in 500 mL), which promotes rapid fluid absorption: ideal for strength training where energy delivery via carbohydrate path is not wanted.

## Taste Architecture

The taste system is designed around four layers, each solving a specific problem. Dissolved in 500 ml water, the mineral base alone tastes metallic (zinc), bitter (magnesium malate), salty (sodium citrate, NaCl), and slightly soapy at alkaline pH. Every ingredient in the taste system has a job.

**Acids — tartness, pH correction and mineral masking (1,100 mg)**

Citric acid (600 mg) delivers the immediate sharp "pop" of sourness — the first thing you taste. Malic acid (500 mg) provides a smoother, longer-lasting sourness that specifically masks metallic and bitter off-notes better than citric acid alone. The 55:45 citric-to-malic ratio is industry standard for electrolyte beverages. Together, at a combined concentration of ~0.22% in 500 ml, they pull the solution pH down from ~8.0 to approximately **5.0–5.5** — the sweet spot for taste, tooth safety (enamel erosion kicks in below pH 4.5), and ingredient stability.

**Sweeteners — sweetness, mouthfeel and aftertaste control (2,050 mg)**

Stevia Reb-A 97% (50 mg) provides the primary sweetness, equivalent to roughly 10–15 g of sugar in 500 ml — deliberately light and refreshing rather than sugary. Erythritol (2,000 mg) at 0.4% concentration sits below its own sweetness threshold, so it isn't really there for sweetness. It adds body and mouthfeel to what would otherwise feel like thin mineral water, provides a mild cooling sensation that reads as "refreshing," and — critically — suppresses the bitter/licorice aftertaste that stevia carries even at high purity. This synergy is well-documented and is why the combination works where stevia alone often doesn't.

**Flavoring — character and carrier (800 mg)**

A spray-dried flavoring at 800 mg per serving, composed of approximately 300 mg volatile flavour compounds and 500 mg maltodextrin DE 10–12 carrier. The low dextrose equivalent carrier was chosen to minimise hygroscopicity in the dry powder (supporting the anti-caking strategy) and to reduce Maillard browning potential during storage. Adds less than 2 kcal per serving.

**Flavour direction**

Citrus profiles (lemon-lime, blood orange, grapefruit) are recommended for initial development. The citric-malic acid backbone matches what the palate expects from citrus, making mineral masking easiest. Berry variants (raspberry, blackcurrant) benefit from shifting the ratio slightly toward malic acid. Tropical profiles (mango, passionfruit) may require pushing stevia to 60 mg for adequate sweetness.

The overall sweet-sour balance leans tart — this is intentional. Electrolyte drinks that lean sweet cause flavour fatigue during exercise, while tart-forward profiles encourage continued drinking. If testers find it too sharp, the first adjustment should be pushing stevia to 60 mg rather than reducing acid, which would compromise mineral masking and pH correction.

> Worth noting: citrus flavors (lemon/lime, orange) do a much better job masking mineral taste than vanilla or creamy (chocolate, milk) profiles

**Magnesium** (120 mg — 32% NRV — qualifies as "high in magnesium"):

- Magnesium contributes to electrolyte balance
- Magnesium contributes to normal muscle function
- Magnesium contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism
- Magnesium contributes to a reduction of tiredness and fatigue
- Magnesium contributes to normal protein synthesis

**Zinc** (10 mg — 100% NRV — qualifies as "high in zinc"):
