# Impossible Powder

## TL;DR

**An electrolyte powder specifically made for strength training**

Most electrolyte mixes are built for long cardio sessions. That’s why they’re heavy on sodium and sugar. If you hit the gym and lift weights, that approach doesn’t really match what you’re doing.
During resistance training, sweat loss is lower, but mineral turnover (especially magnesium and zinc) still matters for performance and recovery.

Impossible Powder keeps sodium and sugars modest while provides what you most need to support training volume and recovery. No empty sugar, no filler vitamins and no vitamin C mega-doses that interfere with strength adaptations.

### Taste & Sweeteners

The sweetener system mirrors what most zero-sugar electrolyte brands already use: stevia plus erythritol.

* **Stevia (40 mg):** High-purity Reb-A minimizes bitterness
* **Erythritol (1.5 g):** Adds body and smoothness without GI issues common to other sugar alcohols
* **Dual-acid system:** Citric acid gives immediate brightness; malic acid provides a smoother, longer-lasting sourness and aligns with the magnesium malate used in the formula

> Citrus flavors (lemon/lime, orange) tend to mask mineral notes better than berry profiles.

**Where Impossible Powder stands out**

* Higher potassium than any major competitor
* Magnesium dosed meaningfully and in malate form
* Zinc included at a full daily value
* Taurine added at an evidence-supported dose
* Acid system designed for both taste and metabolism
* Sodium kept intentionally moderate for lifting, not endurance

> Electrolytes built around what actually happens in the gym, not a marathon.
