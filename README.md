# Impossible Powder

## TL;DR

**An electrolyte powder specifically made for strength training**

Most electrolyte mixes are built for long cardio sessions. That's why they're heavy on sodium and sugar. If you hit the gym and lift weights, that approach doesn't really match what you're doing.
During resistance training, sweat loss is lower, but mineral turnover (especially magnesium and zinc) still matters for performance and recovery.

> Impossible Powder keeps sodium and sugars modest while providing what you most need for strength training: meaningful doses of magnesium, zinc, potassium and copper — all in EU-authorised forms with full regulatory compliance. No empty sugar, no filler vitamins and no vitamin C mega-doses that interfere with strength adaptations.

### Ingredient Breakdown

| Ingredient                     | Amount       | Why it's here                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tripotassium Citrate           | 790 mg       | Citrate form improves mineral absorption and supports neuromuscular function. Dosed to meet EU "source of" threshold for potassium health claims                       |

| Erythritol                     | 1,500 mg     | Adds body and mouthfeel; zero calories and no glycemic impact                                                                                                           |
| Flavoring (maltodextrin-based) | TBD          | Used only for flavor masking                                                                                                                                            |
| **Total (before flavoring)**   | **5,528 mg** |                                                                                                                                                                         |

**Serving size:** ~5.5–6.5 g mixed into 500 ml–1 L of water
**Recommended intake:** 1–2 servings per day

> Note: The formula's citrate load (~1g total citrate) produces a modest alkalinizing effect that is protective against kidney stones and mildly supportive of exercise buffering. The solution is hypotonic (~120 mOsm/kg in 500 mL), which promotes rapid fluid absorption: ideal for strength training where energy delivery via carbohydrate path is unnecessary.

### EU-Authorised Health Claims

The following claims are authorised under Commission Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 and may be used on labelling and marketing materials, provided the product meets the relevant "source of" (≥15% NRV) or "high in" (≥30% NRV) conditions per Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.

**Magnesium** (120 mg — 32% NRV — qualifies as "high in magnesium"):

- Magnesium contributes to electrolyte balance
- Magnesium contributes to normal muscle function
- Magnesium contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism
- Magnesium contributes to a reduction of tiredness and fatigue
- Magnesium contributes to normal protein synthesis

**Zinc** (10 mg — 100% NRV — qualifies as "high in zinc"):

- Zinc contributes to normal protein synthesis
- Zinc contributes to the maintenance of normal testosterone levels in the blood
- Zinc contributes to the normal function of the immune system

**Potassium** (300 mg — 15% NRV — qualifies as "source of potassium"):

- Potassium contributes to normal muscle function
- Potassium contributes to normal functioning of the nervous system
- Potassium contributes to the maintenance of normal blood pressure

**Copper** (1 mg — 100% NRV — qualifies as "high in copper"):

- Copper contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism
- Copper contributes to normal functioning of the immune system
- Copper contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress
- Copper contributes to normal functioning of the nervous system

> Note: Taurine has no EU-authorised health claims. EFSA evaluated taurine for claims relating to immune function, metabolism, cognition, cardiac function, muscle function and exercise fatigue (EFSA-Q-2008-1398 et al.) — all were rejected. No function claims may be made for taurine on consumer-facing materials.

### EFSA Upper Limit Compliance

| Nutrient  | Per Serving | Per 2 Servings | EFSA UL (supplemental)  | 2-Serving Status          |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Magnesium | 120 mg      | 240 mg         | 250 mg/day              | ✅ 10 mg under UL         |
| Zinc      | 10 mg       | 20 mg          | 25 mg/day (all sources) | ✅ 5 mg under UL           |
| Copper    | 1 mg        | 2 mg           | 5 mg/day                | ✅ 3 mg under UL           |

All minerals remain within EFSA Tolerable Upper Intake Levels at the maximum recommended intake of 2 servings per day.

### Taste & Sweeteners

The sweetener approach is stevia plus erythritol — same combo most zero-sugar electrolyte brands already landed on, because it works.

1. **Stevia (40 mg)** — We went with high-purity Reb-A specifically to cut the bitterness problem cheaper stevia extracts have.

2. **Erythritol (1.5 g)** — This is what gives the drink some body. Without it, you're basically drinking mineral water with flavor oil. Unlike other sugar alcohols (looking at you, sorbitol), erythritol doesn't cause GI issues at this dose.

3. **Dual-acid system** — Citric acid up front for brightness, malic acid underneath for a smoother, longer sourness. The malic acid also isn't random, it pairs with the magnesium malate already in the formula, so the flavor system and the functional ingredients are pulling in the same direction.

> Worth noting: citrus flavors (lemon/lime, orange) do a much better job masking mineral taste than vanilla or creamy (chocolate, milk) profiles

### Mandatory EU Label Statements (Directive 2002/46/EC)

- "Do not exceed the stated recommended daily dose (2 servings)"
- "Food supplements should not be used as a substitute for a varied and balanced diet"
- "Keep out of reach of young children"
- All nutrient amounts declared per serving with % NRV (Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011)
