# Impossible Powder

## TL;DR

**An electrolyte powder specifically made for strength training**

Most electrolyte mixes are built for long cardio sessions. That's why they're heavy on sodium and sugar. If you hit the gym and lift weights, that approach doesn't really match what you're doing.
During resistance training, sweat loss is lower, but mineral turnover (especially magnesium and zinc) still matters for performance and recovery.

> Impossible Powder keeps sodium and sugars modest while provides what you most need to support training volume and recovery. No empty sugar, no filler vitamins and no vitamin C mega-doses that interfere with strength adaptations.

### Taste & Sweeteners

The sweetener approach is stevia plus erythritol — same combo most zero-sugar electrolyte brands already landed on, because it works.

1. **Stevia (40 mg)** — We went with high-purity Reb-A specifically to cut the bitterness problem cheaper stevia extracts have.

2. **Erythritol (1.5 g)** — This is what gives the drink some body. Without it, you're basically drinking mineral water with flavor oil. Unlike other sugar alcohols (looking at you, sorbitol), erythritol doesn't cause GI issues at this dose.

3. **Dual-acid system** — Citric acid up front for brightness, malic acid underneath for a smoother, longer sourness. The malic acid also isn't random, it pairs with the magnesium malate already in the formula, so the flavor system and the functional ingredients are pulling in the same direction.

> Worth noting: citrus flavors (lemon/lime, orange) do a much better job masking mineral taste than vanilla or creamy (chocolate, milk) profiles
