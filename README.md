# Impossible Powder

## TL;DR

**An electrolyte powder built to lift, not to run a marathon.**

Most electrolyte products feature high sodium and sugar content because they're designed for cardio and atlethes who sweat for hours. Power lifters don't need that!
What we actually lose during strength training and what the research says matters for power output and recovery,is magnesium and zinc. 

> Impossible Powder flips the script: low sodium, high magnesium, added zinc and a dose of taurine for recovery. No sugar, no vitamin C megadoses that blunt your gains.

## Formula

| Ingredient | Amount | Why It's There |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| Sodium (citrate/chloride blend) | 175 mg | Enough for basic hydration, not so much you're bloated. Most lifters get plenty from food already. Citrate tastes less salty than pure chloride. |
| Potassium (citrate) | 250 mg | Supports muscle contractions and nerve signaling. Works with sodium, not against it. |
| Magnesium (malate) | 150 mg | The star of the show. 22% of elite athletes are deficient. Brilla & Haley's study showed significant strength gains with magnesium supplementation. Malate form supports ATP production and absorbs well without the laxative effect of oxide. |
| Calcium (citrate) | 60 mg | Small amount for muscle contraction support. Most people get enough from diet, so we're not loading up here. |
| Zinc (bisglycinate) | 12 mg | Supports testosterone levels and protein synthesis. Bisglycinate absorbs better and won't upset your stomach. Surprisingly rare in competitor formulas. |
| Taurine | 1,000 mg | Emerging evidence for reduced muscle soreness and lower creatine kinase levels post-workout. Safe, well-tolerated and gives us another angle competitors don't have. |
| Chloride | 200 mg | Paired with sodium for fluid balance. Nothing fancy. |
| Ascorbic acid | 25 mg | Preservative only — keeps the powder stable. This is 20-40x lower than doses shown to interfere with training adaptations. Not marketed as vitamin C. |
| Citric acid | 400 mg | Flavor enhancement and helps everything dissolve. |

**Serving size:** ~4.5g powder mixed into 500ml or 1l of water

### Taste & Sweeteners

The formula uses stevia (Reb A) + erythritol — same approach as Ultima, Key Nutrients and most credible zero-sugar competitors.

- **Stevia (30-50mg):** Provides sweetness without calories or blood sugar impact. Reb A is the cleanest-tasting steviol glycoside.
- **Erythritol (1-1.5g):** Adds body and mouthfeel that stevia alone can't deliver. Zero glycemic index, no GI distress (unlike maltitol or sorbitol) and about 70% as sweet as sugar.

Citrus flavor profiles (lemon-lime, orange) tend to mask mineral taste better than berry. The citric acid already in the formula helps here.

## Competitive Positioning

| Product | Sodium | Magnesium | Zinc | Taurine | Target User |
|---------|--------|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Impossible Powder** | 175 mg | **150 mg** | **12 mg** | **1 g** | Strength athletes |
| Ultima Replenisher | 55 mg | 100 mg | trace | — | General hydration |
| BPN Electrolytes | 500 mg | 20 mg | — | — | Endurance/heavy sweaters |
| Thorne Catalyte | 480 mg | 40 mg | — | — | Endurance athletes |
| Dr. Berg | 40 mg | 120 mg | trace | — | Keto dieters |
| Sports Research | 400 mg | 40 mg | — | — | General fitness |

**Where impossible is possible:**

- Highest magnesium in the category (150mg vs. typical 20-100mg)
- Only formula with meaningful zinc dosing (12mg vs. "trace" or nothing)
- Only formula with taurine for recovery
- Low sodium by design, not by accident —> can explain *why* lifters don't need 500mg

> Electrolytes finally made for people who lift. Not runners, not cyclists, not people doing zumba.

## To Do

### Taste Testing
- Need to prototype 2-3 flavor profiles (lemon-lime, citrus punch, unflavored) and get feedback on mineral aftertaste
- Test stevia/erythritol ratios — some people are sensitive to stevia's bitter notes at higher concentrations
- Evaluate monk fruit as a stevia alternative or blend component

### Solubility & Mixability
- Magnesium malate and taurine are both water-soluble, but need to verify the full formula dissolves cleanly in cold water without clumping
- Test dissolution time — target under 30 seconds with light stirring
- Check if citric acid level is sufficient to keep everything in solution or if we need to adjust

### Regulatory
* [] Confirm label claims for "supports muscle recovery" / "strength training" don't cross into drug claim territory
* [] Verify all ingredients and doses are GRAS at specified levels
